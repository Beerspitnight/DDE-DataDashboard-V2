Imagine dragging and dropping your raw i‑Ready CSV exports into a slick React interface that parses, validates, and flags errors right in the browser—no back‑end server fuss required. Under the hood, Babel and Webpack bundle modern JavaScript into reusable components that feed cleaned data into dynamic recharts visualizations: bar charts, line graphs, sparklines, you name it. A built‑in FilterBar lets you slice by grade, teacher, or demographic cohort on the fly, with updates so fast it feels like cheating. Administrators get district‑ and grade‑level overviews for strategic planning; teachers dive into class and individual student growth; specialists monitor targeted intervention groups. It’s your i‑Ready data Swiss Army knife—entirely client‑side, zero SQL, and ready to turn spreadsheet dumps into actionable insights with just a few clicks.
